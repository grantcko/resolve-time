## rambles
I think that auto saves shouln't really be counted huh? because that is not evidence of work that is just evidence of auto save settings

i think "Start saving project \[project\]" is evidence of a live save or a manual save that only happes when work is done really.

i bet there are examples of live saves or whatever when the program starts or something very small is done but realistically, i think a session should really only be logged if it lasts 20 minutes or more

actually resolve will automatically go into sleep mode after a while which is a good way to know when work has stopped

so from the first save is when the info should be logged brother

interesting info about log files here: /Users/granthall/Library/Preferences/Blackmagic\ Design/DaVinci\ Resolve/log-conf.xml

llm doublecheck:
which project is missing from this list according to the log files provided
