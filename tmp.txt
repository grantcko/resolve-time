In the quiet of the night, stars gleam,
Whispers of dreams in a moonlit stream.
A world of wonder, vast and wide,
In every heart, where hopes reside.

Mountains tall and rivers deep,
Secrets in the forest, shadows creep.
The dawn will break, a new day's start,
With every beat of a hopeful heart.

Through valleys low and peaks so high,
Underneath the endless sky,
We journey forth, with dreams in tow,
In the dance of life, we grow.

So cherish moments, big and small,
For in the end, they're all we recall.
A tapestry of time, woven tight,
In the quiet of the night, stars light.
