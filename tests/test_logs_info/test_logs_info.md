# Test Logs Info
- Collected information about the log files being tested.

## what should actually be collected from the logs for accurate calulations?
- *18 sets of stats*:
  - 3 test cases for existing masterlogs - blank, missing entries, and overlapping entries
  - ✖️3 runs (for pure log stats from sep-b and for hand timing stats, both with live save and without live save)
  - ✖️2 runs for high and medium accuracy
- all time
  - how many sessions
  - how many total log entries collected
  - how many days worked
  - which projects worked
  - how many hours across all projects
  - how many hours spent on each project
  - how many months
  - when there is missing data
- per month
  - how many sessions
  - how many total log entries collected
  - how many days worked
  - which projects worked
  - how many hours across all projects
  - how many hours spent on each project
  - how many months


## rambles
I think that auto saves shouln't really be counted huh? because that is not evidence of work that is just evidence of auto save settings

i think "Start saving project \[project\]" is evidence of a live save or a manual save that only happes when work is done really.

i bet there are examples of live saves or whatever when the program starts or something very small is done but realistically, i think a session should really only be logged if it lasts 20 minutes or more

actually resolve will automatically go into sleep mode after a while which is a good way to know when work has stopped

so from the first save is when the info should be logged brother

interesting info about log files here: /Users/granthall/Library/Preferences/Blackmagic\ Design/DaVinci\ Resolve/log-conf.xml

llm doublecheck:
which project is missing from this list according to the log files provided

this is eventually huh... yeah I think I want to first just 3 times through then add testing complexity for high accuracy and after hand timing
