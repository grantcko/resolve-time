problem: i have no idea how much time i am spending on davinci resolve video projects, so I can't understand my level of productivity/how much to charge clients.

solution: a computer checks your resolve log files and shows you a breakdown per project, per day, per month, etc of time spent on each project

notes: user should backup log files themselves
