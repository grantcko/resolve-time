## what should actually be collected from the logs for accurate calulations?
what do i need to know from the logs?
when there is missing data

2 seperate sets of numbers across 3 different test cases so 6 iterations:
different sets of numbers for high and medium accuracy
3 test cases for existing masterlogs - blank, missing entries, and overlapping entries

how many sessions
how many days worked
which projects worked
how many hours across all projects
how many hours spent on each project
date range (how many months)

how many sessions per month
how many days worked
which projects worked per month
how many hours spent per month
how much time spent on each project per month

how many total log entries are collected

## rambles
I think that auto saves shouln't really be counted huh? because that is not evidence of work that is just evidence of auto save settings

i think "Start saving project [project]" is evidence of a live save or a manual save that only happes when work is done really.

i bet there are examples of live saves or whatever when the program starts or something very small is done but realistically, i think a session should really only be logged if it lasts 20 minutes or more

actually resolve will automatically go into sleep mode after a while which is a good way to know when work has stopped

so from the first save is when the info should be logged brother

interesting info about log files here: /Users/granthall/Library/Preferences/Blackmagic\ Design/DaVinci\ Resolve/log-conf.xml

llm doublecheck: 
which project is missing from this list according to the log files provided
