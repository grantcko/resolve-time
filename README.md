problem: i have no idea how much time i am spending on davinci resolve video projects, so I can't understand my level of productivity/how much to charge clients.

solution: a computer checks your resolve log files and shows you a breakdown per project, per day, per month, etc of time spent on each project



USER JOURNEY 1:
  stories
    as a user i can give my log file folder so that the app can analyse it
    as a user i can read a breakdown of time spent so that i can learn about my effort
    as a user i can read a heatmap graph including total days spent editing so that i can learn about my consistency


notes:
  user should backup log files themselves
  things to learn: python syntax brush up, python tests (including which tests make to ensure no problems),
  i must understand how to write the tests and the basic stucture of the app (which files, methods, arguments, etc.) before I start talking to LLMs. I don't want advice or any extra information until i have a footing. I need to know what i want before I ask for help from someone who who doesn't understand reality like i do
i would like to continure learning unit test so i can really understand how to make tests for all the use cases i need and understand what things are, the lines of code i don't know what they do
